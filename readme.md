###Very brief instructions

1. Add your own twitter credentials in line 9-12 of twitterbase.js (you'll need a twitter dev account and to create an app in it)
2. npm install
3. node server.js
4. Wait for a moment and see the app log the tweets for people with the 'cats' keyword. You can change what to look for in line 15 of twitterbase.js
